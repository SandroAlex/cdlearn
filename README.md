## Overview

Python package intended to manipulate and analyze climate data in the framework of Granger causality and machine learning. It is currently being developed in the context of my atmospheric physics [PhD thesis](https://github.com/SandroAlex/phd). Please feel free to see [cdlearn's documentation](https://cdlearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?), and note that suggestions and corrections are always welcome.
