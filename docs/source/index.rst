Climate Data Learn (cdlearn)
============================

Welcome to cdlearn's documentation. This is a simple python package that I 
am currently developing as part of my PhD thesis in atmospheric physics. 
The main goal of my research is to better understand biosphere-atmosphere 
interactions in South America. For doing this, I have been applying some 
statistical learning methods to model these interactions.
